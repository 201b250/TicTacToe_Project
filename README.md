# TicTacToe_Project

This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe made for Android using Java and Android SDK. But there is a slight twist. Instead of the traditional Xs and Os, two kinds of birds are used here, namely parrot and sparrow. 
- The user can play the game in an interactive interface.
- The player who succeeds in placing three of their choices in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction is declared the winner.
- The app contains a reset button using which the player can reset the whole game and start afresh.
- Using the Toast property, it also displays details related to each move which the user plays. The Toast property also prints the winner player details when any player wins the round.
- Invalid moves are not allowed and you cannot change any previously played choice!
